## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

original_data <- vroom::vroom("winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")

skim(original_data)

describe(original_data) 

head(original_data)

original_data_process<-original_data %>% 
  clean_names(original_data_process)


```

```{r}

ggplot(original_data, aes(x=price)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(original_data, aes(x=price)) +geom_histogram(binwidth=20)

```

```{r}
#List of all wineries with for entries with no country.
data_process_1 <- original_data %>% 
  filter(is.na(country)) %>% 
  summarise(winery) %>% 
  distinct()

#New list of missing wineries with existing countries.
data_process_2 <- inner_join(original_data, data_process_1, by = "winery") %>%
  group_by(winery, country) %>% 
  summarise(country,winery) %>% 
  distinct()

country_list <- original_data %>% 
  summarise(country) %>% 
  distinct()

winery_list <- original_data %>% 
  group_by(winery) %>% 
  summarise(winery) %>% 
  distinct()

data_process_4 <- left_join(data_process_1, data_process_2, by = "winery") %>%
  group_by(winery, country) %>% 
  summarise(country,winery) %>% 
  distinct()



```
