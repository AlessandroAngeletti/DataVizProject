## Guidelines

DATAVIS GROUP  PROJECT 
1. load and inspect data (vroom, skim)
2. clean data - variable types, null values, missing values, outliers, categorical variables (cross column sense check)
3. look for trends and relations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) 
4. feature engineering? (like cumulative_14_day_cases in covid data) - look into new columns we can create
5. visualisations (at least 3 different types of charts - let's do a map as well hehe)
6. focus on a story throughout + conclusion

DELIVERABLES 
1. group presentation to be uploaded on canvas
2. github repo + public repo with readme file
3. one page description of project + questions we're trying to answer
4. rmd file
